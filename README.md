# CPU Ray Tracer

A C++ CPU ray tracing project built for learning and experimentation.

## Key Features

*   Ray-sphere intersection
*   Interactive camera with keyboard controls
*   Multi-threaded rendering
*   Scene loading from `scene.txt` (materials, objects, render settings)
*   Basic materials: diffuse, specular (sharp to rough), emissive
*   Supersampling for anti-aliasing and noise reduction

## Collaboration Note

Developed with assistance from Google's Gemini for algorithm design and code structuring.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Compile with a C++20 compatible compiler (e.g., Visual Studio).
3.  Run the executable.
4.  Modify `scene.txt` in the execution directory to change the scene.
